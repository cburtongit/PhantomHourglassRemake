tiles are 32 x 32

overworld is currently 32 x 24 tiles, total size is 1024 x 768

entities (non-boss) are 32 x 32 but hitboxes and sprites vary.


NEW CAMERA:

move everything but link.

to save on processing for collision checks, I could check the center pixel since link will always be there.


aspect ratio is not 16 : 9 for (256*192)
for 16: 9:
use 43 x 24
