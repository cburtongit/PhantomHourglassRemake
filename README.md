# PhantomHourglassRemake

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass was a Nintendo DS exclusive game released in 2007. 
It was a great game and was a large part of my childhood and in order to practice my python knowledge I
began the task of completely re-making it using Python 3 and some modules like Pygame and Pyganim.

I am a massive fan of the classic artwork used in 16-bit titles, specifically the SNES game, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and due to my limited understanding of 3D graphcis in python at the current time,
the unecessary nature of remaking PH when emulators exsist that can upscale resolution and the redundancy of having a pure remake, I have decided to remake PH in the stle of the aformentioned ALLTP.

Hoping to mainly produce this as a passion project and work on this entirely on my own, although I am welcoming suggestions, art-desgin and other advice or commits if they are offered! 

My knowledge with Git, GitHub and version control is limited at the time of creation so alongside practicing Python, I hope to familiarise myself with VC too.
